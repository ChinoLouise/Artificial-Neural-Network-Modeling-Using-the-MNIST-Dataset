MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is considered as the "Hello World!" version of Deep Learning.

It is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, used to train and test image recognition models.

The model in this project uses Tensorflow 2, specifically the Keras API.

Keras has partitioned the MNIST dataset into 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. Each image itself is a 2D array with the dimensions 28x28 array.
These 28x28 images are represented as unsigned 8-bit integer with values between 0 and 255, where `0` represents black and `255` represents white.
